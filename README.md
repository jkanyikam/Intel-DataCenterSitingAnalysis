# Intel-DataCenterSitingAnalysis

This project analyzes energy and sustainability-related metrics such as energy production and renewable energy usage across US regions to determine the optimal location for the new data center of Intel, a leader in semiconductor manufacturing.

## Data Sourc

This data was provided by Intel's Sustainability Team, who compiled data regarding US regions' energy generation, demand, and renewable energy usage during 2022.

## Analysis Methods

Using Tableau, I created six visualizations and an interactive dashboard:
- **Net Production Bar Chart:** Created a calculated field for Net Production to identify regions that produce a surplus of energy.
- **Supply and Demand Dual Axis Plot:** Built a parameterized time-series chart to compare production vs. demand stability over time.
- **Renewable Energy Bar Chart:** Calculated the percentage of energy sourced from solar, wind, and hydropower to evelauate regions' sustainability.
- **Treemap by Energy Source:** Depicted energy composition by region and balancing authority.
- **Hourly Fluctuation Line Chart:** Measured percentage change in hourly energy generate to illustrate regions' volatility.
- **Energy Source by Region Line Chart:** Enabled time-based comparison of energy sources using interactive filters.
- **Final Dashboard:** Consolidated key visualizations into an interactive dashboard for usage by Intel's sustainability team and stakeholders.

## Key Findings

- Based on the visualizations created, I recommended that the next Intel data center is built in the Northwest region.
- Metrics that backed my recommendation include regions' percentage of energy generation composed of renewable energy sources and net energy production, in which the Northwest ranked 1st and 2nd respectively.
- These findings implied that the Northwest is one of the regions most conducive towards cheap energy usage while providing the most renewable energy percentage-wise. Therefore, it would be most suited to meet Intel's financial needs while satisfying its sustainability initiatives.
